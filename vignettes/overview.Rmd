*linelist* provides a framework for sensible data standardisation for tabular
linelist data commonly used in outbreak analysis. This includes functionality
for guessing dates, cleaning non-standard variable names, and defining a data
dictionary.

# Installing the package

To install the current stable, CRAN version of the package, type:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("linelist")
```

To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the development, *github* version of the package using:

```{r install2, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("reconhub/linelist")
```

Note that this requires the package *devtools* installed.

# Main visible functions of the package

The main functions of the package include:

 - `clean_data()` will standardise variable names by removing spaces and extra
   punctuation, attempt to parse dates with a given tolerance, and convert all
   characters to the closest ASCII approximation
 - `as_linelist()` will convert a data frame to a linelist object, allowing the
   user to define a data dictionary.
 - `epivars()` defines valid variables to be used in the data dictionary
 - `get_var()` accesses a variable from the linelist
 - `set_vars()` adds new dictionary definitions to the linelist
 
Also consider adding some examples.
